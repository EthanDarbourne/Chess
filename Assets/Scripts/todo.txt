RIGHT NOW:
Move origins on all prefabs to correct locations
Fix positionings of pieces on board at start
Pieces should have origins so that setting them at 0,0 centers them in a square.

Now:
Move pieces to captured location
Hotkeys for reset board, load position, save position
Arrow keys to move board position (done)
Implement checks and checkmates on Move.cs
(board has a copy feature that copies the basic parts of the board class)

Little Changes:
HasMoved on Rook should be on base class Piece

Pieces in Unity are not prefabs

Soon:
Create exception classes
Combine ShallowBoard and Board to share functionalities like GetPotentialMoves using interfaces.
Change ShallowBoard.Square and ShallowPiece to struct
Moves all have a getter for a shallow version of themselves
Make sure moves can only be executed for a certain board position

Better handle board positions relative to the world. Place game objects inside a parent object???
Future:
Evaluation bar
	- basic evaluation: based solely on board
	- evaluation with some searching


// need to allow for moves to be created and made solely on shallowboard
// for king simuls
