Backlog:
Create exception classes and add exceptions to work flow
Combine ShallowBoard and Board to share functionalities like GetPotentialMoves using interfaces.

Changes to Make:
Make sure moves that can be made by multiple pieces have that recognized in notation
Pawns should not be sent to graveyards on promotion
Piece movement animations
Add more cameras + ability to change camera
Menus:
	- restart game
	- load position from FEN
	- save position to FEN
	- choose game mode (chess960, standard, king simul)
	- choose sides (white, black, random)
	- settings (sound, graphics, etc)
Consolidate scene scripts
Create file system for saving/loading positions and settings

Menu todo:
Add all options
Buttons can be clicked on to be selected
Buttons load correct game scenes
Scenes take you back to menu upon completion

Each scene should have an object that loads settings like debugging level etc.

Future:
Evaluation bar
	- basic evaluation: based solely on board
	- evaluation with some searching


Optimizations:
	- Interpret moves better -> e4 must be pawn, Nf3 must come from certain squares etc
	- Look for checks from pieces instead of squares
