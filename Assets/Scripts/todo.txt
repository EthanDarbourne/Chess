Now:
Move pieces to captured location
Hotkeys for reset board, load position, save position
Arrow keys to move board position (done)
Implement checks and checkmates on Move.cs
(board has a copy feature that copies the basic parts of the board class)

Soon:
Create exception classes
Combine ShallowBoard and Board to share functionalities like GetPotentialMoves using interfaces.
Change ShallowBoard.Square to struct

Future:
Evaluation bar
	- basic evaluation: based solely on board
	- evaluation with some searching


// need to allow for moves to be created and made solely on shallowboard
// for king simuls
