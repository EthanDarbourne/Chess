RIGHT NOW:
Move origins on all prefabs to correct locations (done)
Fix positionings of pieces on board at start (done)
Pieces should have origins so that setting them at 0,0 centers them in a square. (done)
Rotate Knights???? (done)

Add more cameras
add game saving
add game loading
add menu for loading different game modes (chess960)

Now:
Move pieces to captured location (done)
Hotkeys for reset board, load position, save position
Arrow keys to move board position (done)
Implement checks and checkmates on Move.cs (done)
(board has a copy feature that copies the basic parts of the board class)

Little Changes:
HasMoved on Rook should be on base class Piece

Soon:
Create exception classes and add exceptions to work flow
Combine ShallowBoard and Board to share functionalities like GetPotentialMoves using interfaces.
Change ShallowBoard.Square and ShallowPiece to struct
Moves all have a getter for a shallow version of themselves
Make sure moves can only be executed for a certain board position

Better handle board positions relative to the world. Place game objects inside a parent object??? (done)
Future:
Evaluation bar
	- basic evaluation: based solely on board
	- evaluation with some searching


// need to allow for moves to be created and made solely on shallowboard
// for king simuls
