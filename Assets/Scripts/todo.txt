Backlog:
Create exception classes and add exceptions to work flow
Combine ShallowBoard and Board to share functionalities like GetPotentialMoves using interfaces.

Changes to Make:
Make sure moves that can be made by multiple pieces have that recognized in notation
Pawns should not be sent to graveyards on promotion
Piece movement animations
Add more cameras + ability to change camera
Menus:
	- restart game
	- load position from FEN
	- save position to FEN
	- choose game mode (chess960, standard, king simul)
	- choose sides (white, black, random)
	- settings (sound, graphics, etc)
Consolidate scene scripts (done)
Create file system for saving/loading positions and settings
Handle stalemates, threefold repetitions, fifty-move rule etc
Look for insufficient material
Add square highlights for location last piece moved from
Make camera manager into a monobehaviour - if camera manager has a public list, we can add all the cameras into it, instead of registering
Implement correct castling for Chess960
Remove isCheck and isCheckmate from Move.cs
Fix promotions
Better move scheme, IsFree shouldn't return true if connect4 piece is there
Add a move representing the drop of a connect4 piece
Going back a move, undoes moves via gravity on that move
Allow for one click to select a file and highlight where the piece will land, then another click to confirm the landing (done)
When pieces are captured, they should be removed from _blackPieces and _whitePieces
Allow for button manager to programmatically create buttons in menu given list

Add Board settings, like can move through moves

Menu todo:
Add all options
Buttons can be clicked on to be selected
Buttons load correct game scenes
Scenes take you back to menu upon completion
Better lighting

Each scene should have an object that loads settings like debugging level etc.

Future:
Evaluation bar
	- basic evaluation: based solely on board
	- evaluation with some searching


Optimizations:
	- Interpret moves better -> e4 must be pawn, Nf3 must come from certain squares etc
	- Look for checks from pieces instead of squares

Completed:
Move pieces to captured location (done)
Hotkeys for reset board, load position, save position
Arrow keys to move board position (done)
Implement checks and checkmates on Move.cs (done)
(board has a copy feature that copies the basic parts of the board class) (done)
create pieces as prefabs so we can create new pieces for promotion (done)
Move origins on all prefabs to correct locations (done)
Fix positionings of pieces on board at start (done)
Pieces should have origins so that setting them at 0,0 centers them in a square. (done)
Rotate Knights???? (done)
Better handle board positions relative to the world. Place game objects inside a parent object??? (done)
Make sure moves can only be executed for a certain board position (add board hash) (done)
Change ShallowBoard.Square to struct (done)



How to split up board class:
Base functionality:
	- ExecuteMoves
	- MovePiece



Inherited functionality:
	- Setup for start function
	- Select location (function that is called to interact with board and manage game state)
	- Function for checking if game is over
	- Each board should define how pieces move, the set of moves, characteristics that are allowed/not allowed from pieces
	- chessvsconnect4 allows pieces to move past other connect4 pieces but not land on them
	- IsValidPositionAfterMove
